# **Introduction**

Crave the magic of adventure but need the security of cold, hard data? Welcome to **InstaTrip**, your source for perfectly planned travel spontaneity (courtesy of a Google Sheet)

InstaTrip asks you a few simple questions (nothing too deep!), then compiles a hand-picked list of European destinations based on your preferences. Fancy a quick solo trip to Bucharest? A hen party in Amsterdam? Maybe a spicy weekend for two in Istanbul? We’ve got you covered. We'll match the occasion of your trip to your chosen interests: Shopping? *Check.* Dining? *Absolutely.* Nightlife? *Cheers!*

But that's not all, folks. InstaTrip even saves you the trouble of flight searching. Thanks to the Ryanair API, we’ll show you the cheapest ticket to your destination. Decision fatigue is real so let us help you. No need to spend hours searching for flights-- that's time better spent agonizing over how to fit your entire wardrobe + toiletries into a 40cm x 20cm bag :fearful:

Don't forget your passport!

# Project 

This program was created for Portfolio Project #3 (Python Essentials) for The Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer program.

It is intended for adults (and young people with parental supervision) of all walks of life, based in Ireland and/or within reasonable travelling distance to Dublin airport-- people who would like to explore spontaneous European travel. This program is designed to inspire joy:  From the colors to the playful tone, whether the user is landlocked or ready for takeoff, InstaTrip encourages them to imagine all the excitement and anticipation that accompanies planning a big trip. Use it as inspiration, use it for fun, or use it to plot the next great escape from the daily routine :sparkles:

## Design Choices

### Color Scheme

The color and design scheme for the starting screen of **Instatrip** was chosen to give a slightly retro feel, intended to evoke nostalgia-- the travel agencies and city destination posters of yesteryear. The background image for the page, an island sunset, inspired the color choice for the rest of the program. 

While this project by nature limits styling liberties, I enjoyed colorizing the text and making generous use of emoji to compliment the fun, light-hearted tone set by the copy. Booking flights and tending to travel details can often be a dreary affair. The aim here is to break the tedium and usher in a bit of excitement

# Testing

## Code Validation

| W3 Validator | views.html | 
|--------------|------------|
| html         | Pass       |


| Python De-linter | run.py | 
|--------------|------------|
| python         | Pass       |


I ran the views.html page housing the terminal through the W3 validator after changing the background. Thankfully, this adjustment caused no errors and the page passed validation.

![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **May 14, 2024**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

---

Happy coding!
